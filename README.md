# Acknowledgement  

I've repurposed the awesome work of Reinhard Engel in this [repo](https://github.com/rengel-de/timeline) to create my own d3.js based resume as a timeline.   

# Objective   
 
This is a visual illustration of my professional career development, illustrated as a timeline starting from the time I graduated college, through various major work milestones while highlighting the major skills used around that time. The visual is completely inspired and adapted from Reinhard's work in the repo above so all credit goes to him. I've merely tinkered with the d3.js code to personalize the visual.  

For more details please visit Reinhard's github repo linked above.
